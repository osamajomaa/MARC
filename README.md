# MARC - A Mouse Human Research Classifier

MARC is software tool that classifies biomedical literature and proteins into different classes of research and biological systems respectively. It comprises two parts:

### Entity Networks
MARC classifies the mouse and human scientific literature in PubMed into different areas of research using citation networks and Medical Subject Heading MeSH Thesaurus to identify and study the popular areas of mouse-human research.

### Protein Co-occurrence Networks
MARC also classifies the proteins in this literature citations into different biological systems using protein co-occurrence networks and Gene Ontology to investigate the proteins for which mouse is used as a model organism for human.
